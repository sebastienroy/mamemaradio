this directory contains the design document for the pcb design of the webradio.
The design has been made using Fritzing 0.9.3b

webradio_pcb.fzz document describes the main pcb of the web radio. It is used to connect the raspberry pi zero w component to a power button, a rotary encoder used to change the radio station, and optionnaly to another rotary encoder that can be used to change the volume.

accessories_pcb.fzz document describes accessories pcb. The described pcb has to be cut into 6 parts : 4 rotary encoder pcb and 2 power button pcb. So, parts described by this document can be used for the build of 2 web radios.

The connection between the main pcb and the accessories pcb use F2510-4P connectors. The male headers are soldered on the pcbs, the female headers are wired are used on the wires from the main pcb to the accessories pcb.
