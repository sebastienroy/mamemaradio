2. Plug the power supply of the radio, and wait for the radio to go in sleeping mode (the LCD screen backlight is switched off).
3. **Press simultaneously on the radio station button, and on the power button**
4. The LCD screen backlight is then switched on, and you are now in the network choice mode. The last line of the screen displays a name of an available wifi network
5. Turning the radio station button changes the displayed network. Turn it until is displayed the network noted in step 1. then press the radio station button in order to validate your choice.
6. You need now to enter the password of the network. You need to select each character of the password, one after the other. To select a character, turn the radio station button to move the highlighted letter. Once arrived to the chosen character, press the button in order to select it. The selected characters are displayed in the bottom line. If you make a mistake, you can erase the last character using the character next to the last one of the selection line.
